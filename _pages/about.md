My Blogs  
------  
[Modelling with R](https://modelling-with-r.netlify.app/) is a blog on the overlap between statistical analysis and machine learning. I take machine learning problems and tackle them from a statistical stand-point. I also blog about the methods that I use.  

[teachingR](https://staffblogs.le.ac.uk/teachingr/) is a blog about my approach to teaching R. It links to the material in my `RCourse` github repository.  

[Bayesian analysis with Stata](https://staffblogs.le.ac.uk/bayeswithstata/) is a blog linked to my book of the same name published by Stata Press in 2014. Since publication, Stata have developed their own Bayesian procedures. The book and the blog explain how to use Stata for data handling and then export Bayesian model fitting to OpenBUGS or Stan.
